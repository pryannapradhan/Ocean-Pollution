        <p>Learn about just how much plastic is in the ocean, how it impacts marine life, and how we can all help protect our oceans.</p>

        <h2>Plastic in the Ocean?</h2>
	<h3>8 million metric tons.</h3>
        <p>	A Tesla Cybertruck is 1 ton. We have about 8 million Cybertrucks worth of plastics in our ocean. This is a result of the complacency and wasteful habits we have adopted.</p>
        <p>	Why does this matter? Aside from the harming of marine wildlife, it also contaminates water bodies, degrades habitats and contributes to climate change. This destruction of the ocean in the form of baggies, bottles and toys will trickle back up to humans. Not only will our pristine, aesthetic oceans be gone, along with the unique and beautiful wildlife, but the bodies of water will become toxic and impact our own health.</p>

    <section id="impact">
        <h2>Impact of Ocean Plastic Pollution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Harms marine life (e.g., fish, turtles, seabirds): Fish ingest 12,000 to 24,000 tons of plastic each year, and birds, turtles, mammals and other marine life get trapped in the plastic.</li>
            <li>Damages coral reefs by smothering (blocking sunlight) and causing the corals to ingest microplastics, poisoning them and increasing their vulnerability to disease.</li>
            <li>Threatens human health. Since ocean life we consume is tainted with microplastics, the seafood we cook is contaminated with toxins.</li>
            <li>Killing reefs and the ocean ecosystem will lead to dead zones, or places in the ocean where there is no life. This will impact our climate, biodiversity, economy- virtually every section of our lives.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="solutions">
        <h2>Solutions to Ocean Pollution</h2>
        <p>There are many ways we can reduce ocean pollution:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce plastic consumption</li>
            <li>Proper waste disposal and recycling</li>
            <li>Support ocean clean-up projects</li>
            <li>Educate others about ocean protection</li>
        </ul>
