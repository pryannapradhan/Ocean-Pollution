        <h2>Plastic in the Ocean?</h2>
	<h3>8 million metric tons.</h3>
        <p>	A Tesla Cybertruck is 1 ton. We have about 8 million Cybertrucks worth of plastics in our ocean. This is a result of the complacency and wasteful habits we have adopted.</p>
        <p>	Why does this matter? Aside from the harming of marine wildlife, it also contaminates water bodies, degrades habitats and contributes to climate change. This destruction of the ocean in the form of baggies, bottles and toys will trickle back up to humans. Not only will our pristine, aesthetic oceans be gone, along with the unique and beautiful wildlife, but the bodies of water will become toxic and impact our own health.</p>

        <h2>Impact of Ocean Plastic Pollution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ingestion: Many marine animals, including fish, turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals, mistake plastic debris for food Fish ingest 12,000 to 24,000 tons of plastic each year. Consuming plastic can lead to internal injuries, blockages, malnutrition, and even death.</li>
	    <li>Entanglement: Animals such as seals, whales, turtles, and fish can become entangled in plastic waste like fishing nets, six-pack rings, and plastic ropes. This can restrict movement, cause wounds, or even lead to drowning or strangulation.</li>
	    <li>Chemical Contaminants: Plastics in the ocean often attract harmful chemicals like pesticides, heavy metals, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from the surrounding water. These toxins can be absorbed by marine organisms when they ingest plastic or come into contact with it.</li>
	    <li>Habitat Damage: Plastic debris can accumulate on coral reefs, seagrass beds, and other vital marine habitats. This can cause physical damage to these ecosystems, block sunlight, and disrupt the growth of important species like coral.</li>
            <li>Decreased Visitor Numbers: Plastic pollution on beaches and in oceans can deter tourists from visiting coastal areas, leading to a decline in tourism revenue.</li>
            <li>Increased Cleanup Costs: Tourism destinations may face higher costs for cleaning up plastic debris, affecting the local economy and diverting funds from other services.</li>
            <li>Impaired Recreational Activities: Activities like swimming, snorkeling, diving, and fishing are often negatively impacted by the presence of plastic debris, which can reduce the overall appeal of a destination.</li>
            <li>Visual Pollution: Littered beaches covered with plastic waste can create a negative visual impact, making it less enjoyable for beachgoers and local residents.</li>
            <li>Toxic Chemicals in Seafood: Microplastics can carry harmful chemicals like pesticides, heavy metals, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which can be ingested by marine life. Humans who consume contaminated seafood may be exposed to these toxins, potentially leading to health problems.</li>
            <li>Contaminated Drinking Water: In areas where plastic waste enters freshwater sources or coastal drinking water, the contamination of water supplies could lead to health risks for local populations and tourists.</li>
